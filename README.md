# Tri-Bahtinov Grabber

Written in C# using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017

Based on the Bahtinov grabber created by the late Niels Noordhoek - blog here: http://www.njnoordhoek.com/

The source code was secured by Wytse Jan Posthumus, here: https://github.com/wytsep/bahtinov-grabber 

I have made some small interface modifications to the original source and renamed the program Tri-Bahtinov Grabber after stumbling across this very interesting thread on Cloudy Nights: https://www.cloudynights.com/topic/536410-a-tri-bahtinov-mask-for-sct-collimation-and-focusing/

This is a fully Open-Source project with the Tri-Bahtinov Mask design orignated by cytan: https://github.com/cytan299/tribahtinov
